<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:30.0pt;'>EXISTING
TOKENIZED FUNDS<br>
</span></u></b><br>
Overall, all these funds aim to provide the opportunities of traditional
venture capital to the independent investor by lowering the barriers to entry
for retail investors. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They provide an alternative to VC or PE fund interests. Investors
usually make capital commitments that are subject to calls over a long period
of time and their investments are also locked-up for the duration of the
project complicating any exist of such investments. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By leveraging on blockchain technology, such VC and PE
interests can be tokenized to allow investors to realize returns much sooner
and an earlier exit. This STO was able to provide secondary liquidity for its
investors by way of its tradable tokens listed on digital exchanges and a
regulated (and unregulated) platforms. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To enable tradability, Funds must standardize the terms of
the fund interest so each security token is fungible.</p>

X (CLOSED RULES)</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Times'>A venture capital fund that
invests in opportunities in emerging, next-generation technologies. They target
opportunities at the late seed stage. Investors invest in COSIMO X by
purchasing COSIMO Tokens. Each COSIMO Token is a digitized security that
represents an indirect economic interest in COSIMO X. There is no assurance
that a secondary trading market will ever develop for COSIMO Tokens or that the
COSIMO Tokens will ever be listed on any exchange or trading platform.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Times'>COSIMO expects that upon
exiting an investment, up to 50% of the deal value will be reinvested in the
Fund. The other 50% would be used to repurchase COSIMO Tokens in the open
market. If the Fund invested in a portfolio company in the form of digital
securities, upon exit the Fund then distributes a portion of such digital
securities to COSIMO Token holders.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Times'>COSIMO may, from time to
time, in its sole discretion redeem COSIMO Tokens. Any COSIMO Tokens
repurchased by the fund will be retired. That means, the total value of the
Fund will be distributed over fewer COSIMO Tokens. This increases the
percentage of ownership vested in each remaining COSIMO Token. But there is no
assurance that COSIMO X will ever exercise its right to redeem COSIMO Tokens.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Times'>To provide protection from
dilution they have initially limited the number COSIMO Tokens offered to the
market. But they reserve the right to issue additional COSIMO Tokens, they
intend to make them available only as significant new investment opportunities
warrant. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Times'>If, at any time the market
price of a COSIMO Token drops below 75% of the Fund’s value, the Fund may, in
its sole discretion, make purchases of COSIMO Tokens on the open market. Such
purchased COSIMO Tokens may be resold by the Fund in accordance with applicable
laws.</span></p>
