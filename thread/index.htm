<h1><u>EXISTING TOKENIZED FUNDS</u></h1>
<div class="container-fluid">
  <p>Overall, all these funds aim to provide the opportunities of traditional venture capital to the independent investor by lowering the barriers to entry for retail investors. </p>
  <p>They provide an alternative to VC or PE fund interests. Investors usually make capital commitments that are subject to calls over a long period of time and their investments are also locked-up for the duration of the project complicating any exist of such investments. </p>
  <p>By leveraging on blockchain technology, such VC and PE interests can be tokenized to allow investors to realize returns much sooner and an earlier exit. This STO was able to provide secondary liquidity for its investors by way of its tradable tokens listed on digital exchanges and a regulated (and unregulated) platforms.</p>
  <p>To enable tradability, Funds must standardize the terms of the fund interest so each security token is fungible.</p>
