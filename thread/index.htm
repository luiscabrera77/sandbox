  <h1 class="display-6"><u><strong>EXISTING TOKENIZED FUNDS</strong></u></h1>
  <p>Overall, all these funds aim to provide the opportunities of traditional venture capital to the independent investor by lowering the barriers to entry for retail investors. </p>
  <p>They provide an alternative to VC or PE fund interests. Investors usually make capital commitments that are subject to calls over a long period of time and their investments are also locked-up for the duration of the project complicating any exist of such investments. </p>
  <p>By leveraging on blockchain technology, such VC and PE interests can be tokenized to allow investors to realize returns much sooner and an earlier exit. Through a Security Token Offering (STO) funds are able to provide secondary liquidity for its investors by way of its tradable tokens listed on digital exchanges and a regulated (and unregulated) platforms.</p>
  <p>To enable tradability, Funds must standardize the terms of the fund interest so each security token is fungible.</p>

  <h3 style='background:yellow'>EXAMPLE 1: INVICTUS CAPITAL (ALSO DOING A 10% SHAVE, VERY TRANSPARENT)</h3>
  <p>An investment company/platform that has tokenized several funds. It allows investors to gain access to an underlying basket of assets via a single token.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bitcoin</li>
    <li>Gold</li>
    <li>Solar</li>
    <li>Lending</li>
    <li>Crypto Indexes (2 funds)</li>
    <li>Startups (Venture Capital)</li>
    <li>Tech Stocks</li>
  </ul>

<p><strong>If an investor locks up their capital for as little as 1 month, the investor starts receiving rewards on the form of a TOKEN. 10% of all revenue generated from Invictus funds goes back to the community in the form of tokens. As more people invest, the revenue increases as well as the value of the token. Tokens hold voting rights</strong></p>

<p><strong>Here´s an overview of two of their (several) funds:</strong></p>

<h3>1. CRYPTO 20</h3>
<p>A crypto-only index fund, which used the seed funding to buy the underlying crypto assets. There are no broker fees, no exit fees, no minimum investment and offer transparency through the blockchain. It rebalances on a weekly basis and caps each asset at 10%.</p>
<p>The tokens value is linked directly to the 20 underlying cryptocurrency assets held by CRYPTO20 via a price floor mechanism implemented in a smart contract. The smart contract allows participants to cash out for their share of the underlying assets at any time. This means that C20’s never falls below the token's share of the underlying assets (it will be irrational to sell at a price lower than the tokens share of the underlying assets if a higher price is offered via the smart contract). Token holders are free to sell or exchange their tokens at any time and pay no exit fees, broker fees or advice fees.</p>

<h3 style='background:yellow'>EXAMPLE 2: COSIMO (ESTABLISHING CLOSED RULES)</h3>

<p>A venture capital fund that invests in opportunities in emerging, next-generation technologies. They target opportunities at the late seed stage. Investors invest in COSIMO X by purchasing COSIMO Tokens. Each COSIMO Token is a digitized security that represents an indirect economic interest in COSIMO X. There is no assurance that a secondary trading market will ever develop for COSIMO Tokens or that the COSIMO Tokens will ever be listed on any exchange or trading platform.</p>
<p>COSIMO expects that upon exiting an investment, up to 50% of the deal value will be reinvested in the Fund. The other 50% would be used to repurchase COSIMO Tokens in the open market. If the Fund invested in a portfolio company in the form of digital securities, upon exit the Fund then distributes a portion of such digital securities to COSIMO Token holders.</p>
<p>COSIMO may, from time to time, in its sole discretion redeem COSIMO Tokens. Any COSIMO Tokens repurchased by the fund will be retired. That means, the total value of the Fund will be distributed over fewer COSIMO Tokens. This increases the percentage of ownership vested in each remaining COSIMO Token. But there is no assurance that COSIMO X will ever exercise its right to redeem COSIMO Tokens.</p>
<p>To provide protection from dilution they have initially limited the number COSIMO Tokens offered to the market. But they reserve the right to issue additional COSIMO Tokens, they intend to make them available only as significant new investment opportunities warrant.</p>
<p>If, at any time the market price of a COSIMO Token drops below 75% of the Fund’s value, the Fund may, in its sole discretion, make purchases of COSIMO Tokens on the open market. Such purchased COSIMO Tokens may be resold by the Fund in accordance with applicable laws.</p>
